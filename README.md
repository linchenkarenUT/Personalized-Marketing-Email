# Personalized-Marketing-Email
Email marketing is a useful strategy to promote related products to existing users and to increase the number of potential customers landing on the product page. The success of such email marketing campaigns is usually measured by the click through rate on the emails. The quality and the timing of emails plays a key role in improving this click through rate. Another effective strategy is personalizing the emails for each potential customer. In this project we aim to measure the benefit of personalizing the content and time of marketing emails by comparing the success of such emails with that of a generic email sent at random times during the day.
